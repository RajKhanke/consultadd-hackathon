# SUPPLIER DIVERSITY

The Hazelwood School District has established a Supplier Diversity Program to provide opportunities for the meaningful participation of Minority Business Enterprises (MBEs) and Women Business Enterprises (WBEs) in purchases made by the District. To this end the District has set goals for participation on all construction projects of 25% for MBEs and 5% for WBEs. The Supplier Diversity Program also encourages its business partners to strive for a workforce goal of twenty five percent (25%) minority and five percent (5%) women. The District may reject any and all proposals that do not meet its program goals.

Upon request and verification of need by the Hazelwood School District, the District will pay MBE/WBE contractors every two weeks for labor cost upon presentation of required documentation.

The Hazelwood School District Supplier Diversity Program can be downloaded from the district's website at www.hazelwoodschools.org; on the left side of the home page click on "Proposals and Proposals," then go to the section labeled "Documentation." The entire program including forms A and B are located within the Supplier Diversity document.

The District will accept, as prospective MBE/WBE participants for these projects, only those MBE/WBE firms which have been certified by one or more of the following agencies on or before the date of the proposal opening:

1. City of St. Louis (St. Louis Development Corporation/Airport Authority)

2. St. Louis Minority Supplier Development Council (SLMSDC)

3. Missouri Regional Certification Committee (MRCC)

4. State Certifications, e.g., the State of Missouri and other states

In the case of a manufacturer, the District will also accept MBE/WBE certification by any state division of purchasing or the National Minority Supplier Development Council and its affiliates.
