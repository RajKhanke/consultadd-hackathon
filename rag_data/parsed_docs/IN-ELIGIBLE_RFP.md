# Example #1:

| Between | Minimum | Maximum | % | Lowest Bid | % Applied | Preference $ | Extra Cost |
| - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| | $3,000 | $10,000 | 13.0% | $6,000 | 13% | $6,780 | $780 |


Native Preference: The lowest bid was a non-native with $6,000
the native bidder must meet the 13% native preference.
Meaning, the native bidder's bid must meet or be lower than $6,780 to be eligible for the award.

# EXAMPLE #2:

| Between | Minimum | Maximum | % | Lowest Bid | % Applied | Preference $ | Extra Cost |
| - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| | $25,001 | $50,000 | 11.0% | $48,000 | 11.00% | $53,280 | $5,280 |


Native Preference: The lowest bid was a non-native with $48,000;
the native bidder must meet the 11% native preference.
Meaning, the native bidder's bid must meet or be lower than $53,280 to be eligible for the award.

# EXAMPLE #3: Mohawk Preference Example:

| Between | Minimum | Maximum | % | Lowest Bid | % Applied | Mohawk Preference | Preference $ | Extra Cost |
| - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| | $25,001 | $50,000 | 11.0% | $48,000 | 11.0% | 2% | $54,240 | $6,240 |


Mohawk Preference: The lowest bid was a non-native with $48,000. The Mohawk bidder must
meet the 11% native preference plus an additional 2% added to the percentage scale; making
the total preference percentage 13%.
Therefore, the Mohawk bidder's bid must meet or be lower than $54,240 to be eligible for the
award.

## A. Sliding Scale Calculation Formula
Native American Preference shall be applied to all acquisitions for goods and services
for the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe. Specifically, for the acquisition of goods and
services where price is the determining factor, the preference shall be applied in
accordance with the sliding scale below and by the following steps:

1. Determine low bidder (L).

2. Based on scale, calculate the percent based on low bidder's price (P).

3. Add percentage to low bidder's price which gives the max bid (MB) for the
Native American Owned Business or Company. If the Native bid, (N) is less
than this amount, the native gets the award.

4. So, the calculation is (L x P) + L =MB. If N<MB, Native gets the award.

5. Where price is NOT the sole determining factor, i.e. in RFPs, Native American
Preference may be applied in the proposal review evaluation by the awarding of
additional points for those Native proposers who qualify. The Native American
Preference applied shall be the percentage of the total amount of points
available in the evaluation form.

6. An additional 2% or points (which ever applies) for Mohawk individuals or
businesses also shall be applied if eligible.

The Native American/Mohawk Preference shall be applied to either proposal
evaluation points and to proposal bid price in accordance with the scale
outlined above, whichever has a higher preference value.

In any circumstance, the Native American Preference must be applied after all bidders
or proposers are deemed qualified. Note that Native American Preference cannot
overcome the lack of responsiveness, responsibility or qualification of a bidder.

## B. Factors other than Price

Factors, other than pricing, shall affect whether a firm is "qualified" to be awarded a contract. In these instances, the RFP (request for proposals) shall clearly identify the relative importance of price and other evaluation factors and sub-factors, including the weight given to each technical factor and sub-factor. The proposals shall be evaluated only on the criteria stated in the request for proposals. Native American Preference may be applied as a percentage of identified proposal evaluation points, awarding 10%.

An additional 2% or 2 points for Mohawk individuals or businesses also shall be applied if eligible.

The Native American/Mohawk Preference shall be applied to either proposal evaluation points and to proposal bid price in accordance with the scale outlined above, whichever has a higher preference value.

## Award of Bids

The award shall be made to the qualified company with the lowest responsible bid after the Native American Preference factor has been applied. The Native American Preference factor may be utilized for any bidder who is an approved NAOB that provides a Native American Preference Employment Plan.

# Respiratory Virus Workplace Safety Policy

## Policy Statement

On March 1st 2024, the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) updated and simplified its COVID-19 guidance. The updated CDC guidance establishes a unified approach to all respiratory viruses.

Our updated tribal policy, version 011, will largely reflect the updated CDC guidance and will now be known as the Respiratory Virus Workplace Safety Policy.

## Scope

This policy is applicable to the following covered individuals:

- Tribal employees and elected officials
- Tribal Commission and Board members
- Tribal General Contractors and sub-contractors, and their employees

## Responsibility

It is the responsibility of all covered individuals to adhere to and take the necessary measures to protect themselves and those around them.

## Reporting to Work

All covered individuals must screen themselves for any symptoms of illness prior to reporting to work.

All covered individuals shall not physically report to work if they are exhibiting symptoms of respiratory virus including fever, congestion, cough, headache, runny nose, sore throat or fatigue. If exhibiting any of these symptoms, it is suggested that the individual test for COVID, Influenza or RSV. If in doubt, wear a mask at your work site.

Version 011                SRMT Respiratory Virus Workplace Safety Policy                Page 1 of 3

---

# Reporting of Positive COVID-19 Test Results

Employees testing positive for COVID-19 are required to inform their supervisor immediately.

If symptoms are present the employee must go home.

If no symptoms are present following a positive test, the employee may continue to work but must wear a surgical level or higher mask.

Sick leave due to COVID, RSV or influenza in excess of three days will require a doctor's note, consistent with the SRMT Employee Handbook.

# Returning to Work following Respiratory Virus Illness

Employees and other covered individuals may return to work 24 hours after symptoms improve, and when they have been fever-free for 24 hours without use of medication.

Once the employee or other covered individual returns to work, a surgical level or higher mask must be worn for 5 calendar days.

# Telecommuting Standards

Telecommuting arrangements and expectations are established between supervisor and employee for those positions eligible to telecommute. Telecommute schedules must be approved by supervisors ahead of time.

Employees must be available to respond to work duties while telecommuting during the designated hours of operation. Employees who are telecommuting must respond in a timely fashion to SRMT colleagues (within 60 minutes, generally) and must be available for phone calls when required.

Staff have been entrusted with computer hardware and software to use while telecommuting. Staff are expected to secure all tribal property and data while granted telecommute privileges. Use of tribal hardware and software by family members or any non-employee is prohibited. Violations of this requirement may result in loss of privileges to utilize tribal hardware and software outside of the office setting.

Division Directors, Program Managers, and other Supervisors are expected to be physically present to lead their teams within the office setting as much as possible.

Tribal Programs may seek to establish additional, more-stringent measures, should unique needs and exposure risks be present. Such requests will be subject to review by and approval of the Executive Director.
